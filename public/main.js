    bandRole: "Drums",
    age: 50,
    personalBio: "Tommy is one of the original founders of Battleheart. He has loved music since before he was born. His mother loves to tell stories of how Tommy-in-the-womb would do tumbles for hours when she was around music with a good beat! Tommy inherited his love of music not only from his parents but also his grandfather who played guitar (and the bagpipes!) for The New Jersey Elves in the 50s-60s. He proudly continues the musical tradition of his Irish family and hopes to pass it on to this offspring one day. "

    bandRole: "Keyboard",
    age: 38,
    personalBio: "Paul has been playing piano since high school when the girl he liked (at the time) confessed she loved to sing but could never find a good piano accompanist. He threw himself into learning how to play piano and became that accompanist for about 5 short months. Thankfully, his love of piano and keyboard has outlasted that early relationship. He plays out at a number of venues in the area as Piano Paul."

    bandRole: "Electric guitar & vocals",
    age: 47,
    personalBio: "Milan was inspired to love and dedicate himself tolearn how to play guitar by Eric Clapton. Clapton's albums were the soundtrack of Milan's high school in a  dirty New Jersey high school that was fortunately brimming with a love of the arts and opportunities to perform and discover and develop one's talents. Milan met Luke and Tommy in high school, and Battleheart was born. The rest is history."
